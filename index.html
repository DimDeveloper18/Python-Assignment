                        Food and its management are directly linked to our health. In today's fast-paced lives, people 
                        tend to consume more calories than their bodies require. These excess calories are stored as 
                        body fat. If this pattern continues over time, it may lead to weight gain. When we gain weight, 
                        this can lead to additional health complications. Therefore, it is essential to monitor our 
                        intake of food and drink, as well as the quantities we consume. To assist you in this process, 
                        we have developed a calorie calculator that will allow you to accurately calculate your daily 
                        calorie intake for each meal. This will allow you to adjust your diet accordingly, whether your 
                        goal is to lose weight or merely maintain good health through proper nutrition.

                        <h3>Vegetables</h3>
                        <p>
                            The benefits of vegetables and fruit are priceless. Vegetables aren't just food - they're 
                            vitamins, minerals, and fibers that ensure a healthy body. They provide energy, protect 
                            against disease, and simply bring gastronomic pleasure to a person.

                        <p>
                            Meat contains essential nutrients that are beneficial for human health. It is a rich source 
                            of protein, vitamins, and minerals, which strengthen the immune system and promote overall 
                            body development. Meat consumption can help increase hemoglobin levels, alleviate skin 
                            conditions, and provide sustained energy.

                        <h3>Grains</h3>
                        <p>
                            Wheat, rice, oats and corn are all types of grains. Bread, breakfast cereals, pasta and rice 
                            are all made from these grains. These grains are rich in complex carbohydrates, which provide 
                            the brain, heart and nervous system with a steady supply of energy, allowing the body to move, 
                            breathe and think. In addition, these grain products contain vitamins B and iron, which are 
                            essential for good health.
