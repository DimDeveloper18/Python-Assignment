                    Food and its management are directly linked to our health. In today's fast-paced lives, people 
                    tend to consume more calories than their bodies require. These excess calories are stored as 
                    body fat. If this pattern continues over time, it may lead to weight gain. When we gain weight, 
                    this can lead to additional health complications. Therefore, it is essential to monitor our 
                    intake of food and drink, as well as the quantities we consume. To assist you in this process, 
                    we have developed a calorie calculator that will allow you to accurately calculate your daily 
                    calorie intake for each meal. This will allow you to adjust your diet accordingly, whether your 
                    goal is to lose weight or merely maintain good health through proper nutrition.

                    <h3>Vegetables</h3>
                    <p>
                        The benefits of vegetables and fruit are priceless. Vegetables aren't just food - they're 
                        vitamins, minerals, and fibers that ensure a healthy body. They provide energy, protect 
                        against disease, and simply bring gastronomic pleasure to a person.

                    <p>
                        Meat contains essential nutrients that are beneficial for human health. It is a rich source 
                        of protein, vitamins, and minerals, which strengthen the immune system and promote overall 
                        body development. Meat consumption can help increase hemoglobin levels, alleviate skin 
                        conditions, and provide sustained energy.

                    <h3>Grains</h3>
                    <p>
                        Wheat, rice, oats and corn are all types of grains. Bread, breakfast cereals, pasta and rice 
                        are all made from these grains. These grains are rich in complex carbohydrates, which provide 
                        the brain, heart and nervous system with a steady supply of energy, allowing the body to move, 
                        breathe and think. In addition, these grain products contain vitamins B and iron, which are 
                        essential for good health.
